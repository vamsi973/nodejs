What is node js?


v8 javascript engine

    At the core of Node.js is the V8 JavaScript engine (developed by Google for Chrome), 
    which compiles JavaScript into machine code for fast execution. 
    V8 is optimized for performance and is one of the key reasons behind Node.js's efficiency when handling I/O-intensive tasks.

evenet driven,Non blocking I/O models
    This makes Node.js well-suited for handling large numbers of concurrent connections, such as for web servers or APIs.
        ---Non-blocking means that Node.js does not wait for I/O operations (like reading from disk, making HTTP requests, or accessing a database) to complete before moving on to the next task.
        ---Event-driven means Node.js uses an event loop to manage and handle asynchronous operations, 
           responding to events (such as user input or a completed network request) and triggering callbacks or promises.
Event Loop 
    The event loop is the heart of Node.js's asynchronous programming model. 
    It is responsible for executing all JavaScript code, collecting and processing events, and executing queued sub-tasks.
        --Node.js operates in a single thread and runs code asynchronously, 
        which means that instead of blocking the thread while waiting for I/O operations, it can continue running other tasks.
        --When an I/O operation is needed, Node.js offloads it to the system kernel or a background thread (using libuv, a library that provides asynchronous I/O). Once the I/O operation completes,
        the event loop picks up the callback associated with that task and executes it.
    The event loop has multiple phases, each with specific tasks:
        --Timers: Executes callbacks scheduled with setTimeout() and setInterval().
        --I/O callbacks: Executes almost all callbacks, excluding the ones that are part of timers or close events.
        --Idle, prepare: Internal housekeeping.
        --Poll: Retrieves new I/O events; executes I/O-related callbacks.
        --Check: Executes callbacks scheduled with setImmediate().
        --Close callbacks: Executes close events like socket.on('close').
libuv: Low-Level I/O Handling
    Node.js uses the libuv library to handle non-blocking I/O operations. Libuv provides an abstraction layer over the system’s I/O, 
    enabling Node.js to handle operations like file system access, network requests, and timers asynchronously and efficiently.
        --It includes a thread pool for tasks that require blocking operations (like file system access), allowing Node.js to offload these tasks while the main event loop keeps running.
Modules in Node.js
    Node.js uses a modular architecture that allows you to break down functionality into separate files and then import them into other parts of your application. This is achieved using the CommonJS
        --require() is used to import modules.
        --module.exports or exports are used to expose functionality from a module.
    There are built-in modules, such as fs (file system), http (for creating HTTP servers), 
    and path (for working with file and directory paths), as well as third-party modules that can be installed via npm (Node Package Manager).
Asynchronous Programming
    Node.js is designed around asynchronous programming, and you’ll often see callbacks, promises, and async/await used to manage asynchronous code:
        --Callbacks: Functions passed into other functions that are executed when the task is complete.
        --Promises: Objects that represent the eventual completion (or failure) of an asynchronous operation and its resulting value.
        --Async/Await: Syntactic sugar over promises, allowing asynchronous code to be written in a more synchronous style.
Node.js APIs and Libraries
    Node.js provides an extensive set of built-in modules that allow you to interact with the file system, work with HTTP requests, interact with databases, handle streams, and more. Some of the most commonly used modules include:

        --fs: Interacts with the file system (e.g., read/write files).
        --http: Used to create web servers and make HTTP requests.
        --stream: Works with streams (used for reading or writing data in chunks).
        --path: Utility for working with file and directory paths.
        --os: Provides information about the operating system.
        --url: Utilities for working with urls.
        --events: Allows to evenet driven programming
Node.js Process and Event Loop Interaction
    Node.js runs on a single thread by default, which means that it executes one task at a time. However,
     the event loop allows Node.js to handle asynchronous tasks (like I/O) without blocking the main thread. Here's a simplified flow of how it works:

        --The process starts executing code synchronously.
        --Asynchronous tasks are offloaded (e.g., I/O, database requests).
        --The event loop checks if any asynchronous task is complete and triggers its callback.
        --The process continues handling new incoming requests or tasks asynchronously.
Global Objects in Node.js   
    There are several global objects available in Node.js, meaning you don’t have to require them explicitly:
        process: Provides information about the current process (e.g., environment variables, arguments passed to the process).
        --__dirname: The directory name of the current module.
        --__filename: The full path to the current module.
        --console: Used for logging information to the console.
        --setTimeout and setInterval: Used for scheduling code to run after a certain delay or repeatedly at intervals.
Error Handling in Node.js
    Node.js follows the standard JavaScript error-handling model, which uses try-catch blocks for synchronous code. However, for asynchronous code (especially callbacks), 
    it’s common to pass errors as the first argument to the callback function.
    For promises, you handle errors using .catch() or with async/await and try-catch.
Concurrency vs Parallelism
    Although Node.js operates on a single thread, it can achieve concurrency by handling many I/O tasks at the same time. However, true parallelism (like running multiple threads) can be achieved through techniques like:
        --Using worker threads.
        --Using external tools like cluster to fork multiple processes.
    Node.js can also offload computationally intensive tasks to child processes or worker threads, allowing you to scale your app across multiple cores of a machine.



Worker Threads and Clustering

    Though Node.js is single-threaded, it allows you to use worker threads and clustering to scale applications across multiple CPU cores.
        --Worker Threads: Introduced in Node.js v10, worker threads allow you to run JavaScript in parallel in separate threads.
        --Clustering: This module allows you to spawn multiple child processes (each with its own event loop) to handle different requests, 
            enabling you to take advantage of multi-core systems.

Node.js Process Object
    Node.js exposes a global process object that provides information about the current process.
    You can use it to access environment variables, command-line arguments, and the current working directory.




Node.js is an event-driven, non-blocking runtime built on V8, making it ideal for building scalable network applications.
The event loop manages asynchronous operations, enabling non-blocking behavior, and uses libuv to interact with the OS.
Node.js applications are highly modular and use the CommonJS module system.
Asynchronous programming with callbacks, promises, and async/await is a core part of Node.js development.
Streams, file system handling, HTTP servers, and other modules are readily available, making Node.js an excellent tool for server-side programming.
